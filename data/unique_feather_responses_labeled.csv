0,"2 tons of feathers and 1 ton of bricks both weigh the same amount, which is 1 ton. The difference is in their volume, as feathers are much lighter than bricks, so it would take a larger quantity of feathers to make 2 tons. Therefore, neither is heavier than the other in this scenario.",FAIL
1,"Neither, they both weigh a ton.",FAIL
2,"They are both the same weight, as 2 tons of feathers and 1 ton of bricks both weigh 2 tons.",FAIL
3,2 tons of feathers is heavier.,PASS
4,"They both weigh the same., , A ton is a unit of weight or mass, equal to 2,000 pounds (907 kg)., , So 2 tons of feathers and 1 ton of bricks have the same weight, just different compositions., , This question plays on the perceived notion that feathers are lighter than bricks, which is true for equal volumes. But when comparing by weight/mass units like tons, 2 tons of any material weighs the same as 1 ton of any other material., , The phrasing is meant to trick people into thinking 1 ton of the denser bricks would be heavier than 2 tons of the lighter feathers, when in fact the tons unit already accounts for the weight difference between the materials.",FAIL
5,"2 tons of feathers is heavier than 1 ton of bricks. The weight of an object is determined by how much matter it contains and the force of gravity acting upon it. In this case, 2 tons of any material will always be heavier than 1 ton of any other material. Although it might seem counterintuitive because we usually associate feathers with lightness and bricks with heaviness, the quantity (in this case, tons) is the determining factor for weight.",PASS
8,"They are both equal in weight, as 2 tons of feathers and 1 ton of bricks both weigh 2 tons.",FAIL
10,"They both weigh the same., , A ton is a unit of weight/mass, equal to 2,000 pounds (907 kg). So 2 tons of feathers has the same weight as 1 ton of bricks, because in both cases the weight is 2 tons., , The old riddle plays on the mistaken assumption that feathers, being lighter in density, would weigh less than a denser material like bricks for the same weight measurement. But a ton is a ton, regardless of the material's density. The feathers would just take up much more volume to reach the equivalent 2 ton weight.",FAIL
11,"2 tons of feathers is heavier than 1 ton of bricks. The weight is determined by the ton unit, and 2 tons is more than 1 ton, regardless of the material being weighed.",PASS
15,2 tons of feathers is heavier than 1 ton of bricks.,PASS
16,"They weigh the same., , A ton is a unit of weight/mass. 2 tons of feathers has the same weight as 1 ton of bricks, since a ton is a ton regardless of the material., , This is a classic riddle that plays on the intuition that feathers are lighter than bricks for the same volume. But when comparing strictly by weight/mass units like tons, 2 tons will equal 2 tons whether it's feathers, bricks, or any other material.",FAIL
17,"2 tons of feathers is heavier than 1 ton of bricks. The weight of an object is determined by how much matter it contains and the force of gravity acting upon it.

22,"They weigh the same., , A ton is a unit of weight/mass. 2 tons of feathers and 1 ton of bricks both represent the same weight/mass, just different materials., , This is a classic riddle that plays on the intuition that feathers seem very light compared to dense objects like bricks. But by specifying the weights in tons, it makes the weights equivalent., , So the correct answer is that 2 tons of feathers weighs the same as 1 ton of bricks, since a ton is a ton, regardless of the composition of the objects.",FAIL
23,"2 tons of feathers is heavier than 1 ton of bricks. The weight of an object is determined by how much matter it contains and the force of gravity acting upon it. In this case, 2 tons of any material will always be heavier than 1 ton of any other material, regardless of their densities or volumes. So, 2 tons of feathers is heavier than 1 ton of bricks, even though feathers are much less dense than bricks.",PASS
25,"They both weigh the same, 2,000 pounds.",FAIL
26,"They both weigh the same, 2 tons.",FAIL
28,"They weigh the same., , A ton is a unit of weight/mass, equal to 2,000 pounds. So:, , 2 tons of feathers = 2 x 2,000 lbs = 4,000 lbs, 1 ton of bricks = 1 x 2,000 lbs = 2,000 lbs, , Therefore, 2 tons of feathers weighs the same as 1 ton of bricks, which is 4,000 lbs., , This is a classic riddle that plays on the intuition that feathers are lighter than bricks for an equal volume. But when measured by weight/mass, 2 tons of anything weighs the same as 2 tons of anything else.",FAIL

33,2 tons of feathers are heavier.,PASS
34,"They weigh the same., , A ton is a unit of weight/mass. 2 tons of feathers has the same weight/mass as 1 ton of bricks, since a ton is a ton regardless of the material., , This is a classic riddle that plays on the intuition that feathers seem very light compared to dense objects like bricks. But by definition, 2 tons of any material will equal 1 ton of any other material in terms of weight or mass.",FAIL
35,"2 tons of feathers is heavier than 1 ton of bricks. The weight of an object is determined by how much matter it contains and the force of gravity acting upon it. In this case, 2 tons of any material, including feathers, is heavier than 1 ton of any other material, such as bricks. While it may seem counterintuitive because we usually associate feathers with being light and bricks with being heavy, the quantity of material being compared in this question is the key factor in determining the weight.",PASS

40,"They weigh the same., , A ton is a unit of weight/mass. 2 tons of feathers has the same weight as 1 ton of bricks., , The question is meant as a trick question or riddle, playing on the perception that feathers are very light compared to dense objects like bricks. But when the masses are compared directly using the same unit (tons), they are equivalent., , So the correct answer is that 2 tons of feathers weighs the same as 1 ton of bricks, since a ton is a ton, regardless of the material.",FAIL

52,"They weigh the same., , A ton is a unit of weight/mass. 2 tons of feathers has the same weight/mass as 1 ton of bricks., , The ""ton"" refers to the total weight, regardless of what material makes up that weight. So 2 tons of the light, low-density feathers has the same total weight as 1 ton of the dense bricks., , This is a classic riddle that plays on the intuition that feathers are lighter than bricks. But when dealing with defined weight units like tons, 2 tons will equal 2 tons, regardless of the composition.",FAIL
