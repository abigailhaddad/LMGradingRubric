       "5   As of my knowledge up to October 2021, Daylight Saving Time (DST) is not considered. The time difference between Boston, Massachusetts (Eastern Standard Time) and Copenhagen, Denmark (Central European Time) is 6 hours. When it's 12 PM (noon) on March 26th in Boston, it would be 6 PM on the same day in Copenhagen. However, it is important to note that DST begins on different dates in the U.S. and Europe, so the time difference may vary depending on the specific dates of the switch. In 2022, DST in the European Union starts on the last Sunday of March, while in the U.S., it starts on the second Sunday of March. Therefore, on March 26, 2023, the time difference between the two cities would be 5 hours, as both places would be in DST. Always double-check time differences during the transition periods of DST to ensure accuracy.   \n",
