    "# Automated LLM Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an automated evaluation framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) using a set of predefined prompts and rubrics. The responses from the models are classified based on the rubrics, and the results are visualized in a styled DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Python Packages**: `enum`, `marvin`, `os`, `openai`, `pandas`, `pydantic`, `litellm`, `groq`; see requirements.txt file\n",
    "- **API Keys**: You need API keys for each of the LLM providers you intend to use. These keys should be stored as environment variables in the format `PROVIDER_KEY`. For example, for OpenAI, you would set an environment variable `OPENAI_KEY` with your API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set Up Configuration**: Initialize settings for Marvin and Pandas display options.\n",
    "2. **Define Prompts and Rubrics**: Create a list of prompts and their corresponding rubrics for classification.\n",
    "3. **Process Responses**: For each prompt, call the LLMs, retrieve responses, and classify them based on the rubrics.\n",
    "4. **Visualize Results**: Pivot the DataFrame to have prompts as rows and models as columns, and apply styling to visualize the classification results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "- `final_df`: A DataFrame containing the model, prompt, response, and classification category for each prompt-model pair.\n",
    "- `styled_df`: A styled DataFrame with prompts as rows, models as columns, and cells colored based on the classification category (PASS, FAIL, ERROR).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this framework, you will need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set your API keys as environment variables.\n",
    "2. Define your prompts and rubrics in the `prompt_rubric_pairs` list.\n",
    "3. Run the notebook to generate and visualize the classification results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Customization\n",
    "\n",
    "You can customize this framework by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adding or modifying prompts and rubrics in the `prompt_rubric_pairs` list.\n",
    "- Adjusting the styling in the `colorize` function and `styled_df` creation to fit your preferences.\n",
    "- Changing the LLM providers and models in the `providers_models` dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensure that your API keys are correctly set up and have the necessary permissions for accessing the LLMs.\n",
    "- The classification results are dependent on the rubrics defined and the responses from the LLMs.\n"

       "Neither is heavier - they both weigh exactly the same amount., , 2 tons of feathers and 1 ton of bricks both have a mass of 2,000 kilograms or approximately 4,409 pounds. , , A ton is a unit of mass, and it doesn't matter what material or substance is being measured.

       "Copenhagen, Denmark is in the Central European Time (CET) zone, which is UTC+1. During Daylight Saving Time, which begins on the last Sunday of March, Copenhagen follows Central European Summer Time (CEST), which is UTC+2., , In 2023, Daylight Saving Time in Europe began on Sunday, March 26th. Therefore, at 12 PM (noon) on March 26th in Boston, which observes Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) or UTC-4, the time in Copenhagen would be 6 PM (18:00) CEST., , To summarize:, Boston, USA: March 26th, 12:00 PM (noon) EDT (UTC-4), Copenhagen, Denmark: March 26th, 6:00 PM (18:00) CEST (UTC+2), , Please note that the exact date of the Daylight Saving Time change might vary in different years, so it's always a good idea to double-check the specific dates for the year in question.                                                                                                                                                                                           10  \n",

       "Neither is heavier - they both weigh exactly the same amount., , 2 tons of feathers and 1 ton of bricks both have a mass of 2,000 kilograms or approximately 4,409 pounds. , , A ton is a unit of mass, and it doesn't matter what material or substance is being measured. A ton of feathers, a ton of bricks, a ton of cotton candy, or a ton of anything else will always have the same mass and weight., , This question is often asked as a trick question or riddle, playing on the intuition that bricks are denser and \"feel\" heavier than feathers.
