    "# Automated LLM Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an automated evaluation framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) using a set of predefined prompts and rubrics. The responses from the models are classified based on the rubrics, and the results are visualized in a styled DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Python Packages**: `enum`, `marvin`, `os`, `openai`, `pandas`, `pydantic`, `litellm`, `groq`; see requirements.txt file\n",
    "- **API Keys**: You need API keys for each of the LLM providers you intend to use. These keys should be stored as environment variables in the format `PROVIDER_KEY`. For example, for OpenAI, you would set an environment variable `OPENAI_KEY` with your API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set Up Configuration**: Initialize settings for Marvin and Pandas display options.\n",
    "2. **Define Prompts and Rubrics**: Create a list of prompts and their corresponding rubrics for classification.\n",
    "3. **Process Responses**: For each prompt, call the LLMs, retrieve responses, and classify them based on the rubrics.\n",
    "4. **Visualize Results**: Pivot the DataFrame to have prompts as rows and models as columns, and apply styling to visualize the classification results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "- `final_df`: A DataFrame containing the model, prompt, response, and classification category for each prompt-model pair.\n",
    "- `styled_df`: A styled DataFrame with prompts as rows, models as columns, and cells colored based on the classification category (PASS, FAIL, ERROR).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this framework, you will need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set your API keys as environment variables.\n",
    "2. Define your prompts and rubrics in the `prompt_rubric_pairs` list.\n",
    "3. Run the notebook to generate and visualize the classification results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Customization\n",
    "\n",
    "You can customize this framework by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adding or modifying prompts and rubrics in the `prompt_rubric_pairs` list.\n",
    "- Adjusting the styling in the `colorize` function and `styled_df` creation to fit your preferences.\n",
    "- Changing the LLM providers and models in the `providers_models` dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensure that your API keys are correctly set up and have the necessary permissions for accessing the LLMs.\n",
    "- The classification results are dependent on the rubrics defined and the responses from the LLMs.\n"
