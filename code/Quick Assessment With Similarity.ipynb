    "# Can We Use LLM Evals + Semantic Distance To Do Classification? Let's See!\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "This framework provides an automated evaluation method for Large Language Models (LLMs) by using an LLM grader plus semantic embeddings. It involves a set of predefined prompts, generates responses from various models, and grades them with an LLM grader. It then splits the responses by model, does embeddings with all of the responses, and assigns the query responses the same classification as the semantically-closest reference response. We then test to see if this is accurate.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Requirements\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Python Packages**: `enum`, `marvin`, `os`, `openai`, `pandas`, `pydantic`, `litellm`, `groq`, `numpy`, `torch`, `transformers`, `scipy`. See the requirements.txt file in th repo if you want to use that. \r\n",
    "- **API Keys**: API keys for each LLM provider are required. These should be stored as environment variables following the `PROVIDER_KEY` format, e.g., `OPENAI_KEY` for OpenAI.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Workflow\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. **Configuration Setup**: Initialize settings for `marvin`, `pandas`, and model/tokenizer from `transformers`.\r\n",
    "2. **Prompts and Rubrics Definition**: Specify prompts and corresponding rubrics for evaluating responses. Rubrics categorize responses based on criteria set by the user.\r\n",
    "3. **Response Generation and Classification**: Call LLMs to generate responses for each prompt, classify these responses using `marvin`, and encode responses into semantic embeddings.\r\n",
    "4. **Semantic Analysis**: Split the encoded responses into reference and query sets, find the closest semantic matches between sets, and categorize the query responses based on their closest reference match.\r\n",
    "5. **Result Table**: Display the original and closest matched responses along with their categories, highlighting the semantic alignment between models.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Outputs\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Encoded Embeddings**: Embeddings represent the semantic content of each response, facilitating the comparison.\r\n",
    "- **Reference and Query Sets**: Splitting the data allows for a dynamic evaluation, reflecting a more real-world application where models are compared based on similarity to a reference.\r\n",
    "- **Semantic Match Analysis**: Results that include the closest reference response and category for query responses.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Usage\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "To utilize this framework:\r\n",
    "1. Ensure your environment is set up with necessary API keys.\r\n",
    "2. Populate `prompt_rubric_pairs` with your chosen prompts and evaluation criteria.\r\n",
    "3. Execute the notebook to process responses, perform semantic analysis, and visualize outcomes.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Customization\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "This framework is highly customizable:\r\n",
    "- **Prompts and Rubrics**: Modify or extend the `prompt_rubric_pairs` list to include new evaluation scenarios.\r\n",
    "- **Model Choices**: Adjust the `providers_models` dictionary to test different LLMs.\r\n",
    "- **Semantic Analysis**: Experiment with different models for embeddings to best suit your data or domain-specific needs.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Notesnecessary. Don't run models you don't have keys set up for. \n",
    "- Your rubric doesn't need to be totally accurate in order to test this out, since we're evaluating consistency rather than correctness. But it would still be good if it were accurate.\n",
    "- Very preliminary results: I'm getting better results when I specify that I want a short answer.embedding model and the defined rubrics.ance across a range of prompts and contexts."
